Installed Java 17 manually due to Maven build failure with Java 11:
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y

Rebuilt the PetClinic application manually inside the app VM:
./mvnw clean package

Verified Java version and ensured JDK was correctly installed:
java -version

Connected from app_vm to MySQL on db_vm using:
mysql -h 192.168.56.10 -u petuser -p

Installed MySQL client manually on app_vm to support this test:
sudo apt install mysql-client -y
